# Is growing a city as simple as focusing on the basics of education?

This morning, some small portion of Albany goes to the polls to vote in a special election on a referendum to fund major renovations and additions to Albany High School (it's the one that serves the whole city). The original referendum was voted down by a slim margin, which to homeowners seemed short-sighted. The school is old and in some disrepair.
